# machine_Learning_Octave

Here are implementations of the main concepts of machine learning thought by professor Andrew NG from university of Standford. Math concepts are available for free on coursera.org where you can learn how each of these algorithms work. There are also other versions of these codes available online. I put this here for my personal reference to refer to when it's needed. feel free to use it. all credit goes to professor Andrew NG who explained all the concepts in a nice manner.
